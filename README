SCEPTIC3D: Specialized Coordinate Electrostatic Particle and Thermals In Cell 3D


This package contains:

	1) the SCEPTIC3D code (main folder)
	2) a library of graphic functions (accis)


Optional functionality available in separate archives:

	1) a subfolder required for HDF5 output (hdf5-1.8.4)
	2) matlab postprocessing tools (Matlabtools)



Building SCEPTIC3D on a linux system
_______________________________________________________________________

`make sceptic3D` builds the serial version with ASCII output.
Note that this requires the development versions of the Xt and X11 libraries.

`make sceptic3Dmpi` builds the parallel version with ASCII output.
Note that this also requires an MPI implementation (tested with MPICH2).

`make sceptic3Dhdf` builds the serial version with HDF output.
Note that this also requires the folder hdf5-1.8.4 to be in the
sceptic3Dprod directory. 

`make sceptic3Dmpihdf` builds the parallel version with HDF output.



Running SCEPTIC3D
_______________________________________________________________________

`./sceptic3D` gives a usage message listing the available flags.

Example:
`mpirun -n 8 ./sceptic3Dmpi -l1 -t0.1 -v0.5 -x20 -s1000 -nr100
-nt30 -np30 --bz1.25 -f -g --sp`

This example runs the mpi version of SCEPTIC3D with L_De=1, T_i=0.1,
v_d=0.5, r_b=20, nsteps=1000, n_r=100, n_theta=30, n_psi=30, B_z=1.25,
without graphical output, and using the parallel Poisson solver.

A detailed explanation of the normalizations is given in the references
listed in the header of the file sceptic3D.F.



Reading SCEPTIC3D .dat files
______________________________________________________________________

After a run is complete, sceptic creates a .dat file.

The .dat file can be read with ./tools./postproc:

Example:

./postproc -f -b -n -t -e -l ./../T1m1v050r20P04L1e0B12m1.dat

running ./postproc without flags gives some help

Several ./dat files with different magnetic fields can be analyzed
together using postprocB.

Example:

./postprocB ./../T1m1v050r20P04L1e0B*.dat



Reading SCEPTIC .dat files using matlab
_____________________________________________________________________

The folder Matlabtools contains several Matlab routines to perform
essentially the same tasks as the fortran tools.



ACCIS
_____

The subdirectory accis contains a graphics library used by SCEPTIC3D
(copyright Ian Hutchinson).

It will compile automatically, but both codes depend on having the X11
libraries in the usual places.

A guide for the accis routines is in accis/accissum.tex.

In general, when the graphics plotting completes, and the program pauses,
left click the mouse in the graphics window to continue.
